    No instance for (Show r0) arising from a use of ‘show’
    The type variable ‘r0’ is ambiguous
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance Show Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      instance Show Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      instance (Show a, Show b, Number a, Digit b) => Show (a :@ b)

      ...plus 26 others
    In the expression: show
    In the expression: show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
